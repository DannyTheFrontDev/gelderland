Water is essential for life. We assume that water will never run out. But the world and the climate are changing. We increasingly realize that the value of water and the importance of sustainable water management are not sufficiently recognized. Researchers from Wageningen Environmental Research and academics from the Department of Environmental Sciences work together from different perspectives to improve the quality of life by optimizing water management for a clean, safe and healthy living environment.
